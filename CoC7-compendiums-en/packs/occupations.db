First Aid (and only First Aid) can save the life of a dying character, after which they must receive a successful Medicine roll or be hospitalized (within one hour), if this does not happen, the temporary hit point is lost and the character is dying. In the case of a dying character, a CON roll must be made at the end of each round; if the roll is failed, the character dies. If the character survives until the following round, First Aid can be attempted again (by up to two individuals). This can be continued (without constituting a Pushed roll) until stabilization or death. Thus, First Aid is an important skill to have, alongside Medicine, if you wish to bean all-round medic.</p>\n<h2>Opposing skill/Difficulty level:</h2>\n<p>Administering First Aid to a fellow human is always of Regular difficulty level.

Formal psychotherapy was still in its infancy in the 1890s, though some procedures are as old as humanity. Sometimes it was looked on as a fraudulent study even in the 1920s. The common term then for an analyst or scholar of emotional disorders was &lsquo;alienist&rsquo;. In the present day, a combination of therapies has evolved, and this skill now could be justly named Psychiatric Treatment.</p>\n<p>Intensive psychoanalysis can return Sanity points to an investigator patient. Once per game month, to learn the progress of the therapy, make a 1D100 roll against the analyst or doctor&rsquo;s Psychoanalysis skill. If the roll succeeds, the patient gains 1D3 Sanity points. If the roll fails, add no points. If the roll is fumbled, then the patient loses 1D6 Sanity points, and treatment by that analyst concludes: there<br />has been some sort of serious incident or dramatic setback in the therapy, and the relationship between patient and therapist has broken down beyond saving.</p>\n<p>In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recovery from indefinite insanity, which requires 1D6 months of institutional (or similar) care, of which psychotherapy may form a part.</p>\n<p>Successful use of this skill can allow another person to cope with the subject of their phobia for a short time, or to see delusions for what they are. In play this would allow for an insane investigator to ignore the effects of a phobia or mania for a brief period, allowing a claustrophobe to hide in a broom cupboard for ten minutes, for example. Equally a person might make a Psychoanalysis roll to help a delusional investigator see through their hallucination for a brief period.</p>\n<p>Treatment by a psychotherapist can add Sanity points during indefinite insanity (see Sanity).</p>\n<p>Psychoanalysis cannot increase a person&rsquo;s Sanity points above 99&ndash;Cthulhu Mythos.</p>\n<h2>Opposing skill/Difficulty level:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular difficulty: standard therapy within a hospital setting.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hard difficulty: intermittent therapy over a longer period.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pushing examples:</h2>\n<p>This is a skill, which can be attempted month after month without requiring a Pushed skill roll.

If the roll fails, add no points.

Intimidate is opposed by Intimidate or Psychology.</p>\n<p>Backing up intimidation with a weapon or some other powerful threat or incentive may reduce the difficulty level. When Pushing an Intimidation roll, one possible consequence of failure is carrying out one&rsquo;s threat, perhaps beyond the level of that which was intended.</p>\n<p>Intimidate may be used to force down the price of an item or service. If successful, the seller is may reduce the price, or hand the item over free of charge, but depending on the situation they may later report the incident to the police or to members of the local organized crime gang. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Opposing skill/Difficulty level:</h2>\n<p>See Charm, Fast Talk, Intimidate and Persuade skills: setting the difficulty level.</p>\n<h2>Pushing examples:</h2>\n<p>Causing actual physical harm to the target or to something or someone that the target cares about.

If the threats are retracted and the investigator then tries to befriend the target, it may become Charm; or if a protracted and unthreatening discussion ensues, it may become Persuade.
