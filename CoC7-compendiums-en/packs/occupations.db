A similar situation exists in England, with touring repertory companies traveling the counties, with London the heart of theatrical shows. Touring companies travel by train, presenting new plays, as well as classics by Shakespeare and others. Some companies spend considerable amounts of time touring foreign parts, such as Canada, Hawaii, Australia, and Europe.</p>\n<p>With the introduction of \"talkies\" in the latter part of the 1920s, many stars of the silent films era cannot cope with the transition to sound.
