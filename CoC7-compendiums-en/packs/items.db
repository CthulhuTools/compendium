Formal psychotherapy was still in its infancy in the 1890s, though some procedures are as old as humanity. Sometimes it was looked on as a fraudulent study even in the 1920s. The common term then for an analyst or scholar of emotional disorders was &lsquo;alienist&rsquo;. In the present day, a combination of therapies has evolved, and this skill now could be justly named Psychiatric Treatment.</p>\n<p>Intensive psychoanalysis can return Sanity points to an investigator patient. Once per game month, to learn the progress of the therapy, make a 1D100 roll against the analyst or doctor&rsquo;s Psychoanalysis skill. If the roll succeeds, the patient gains 1D3 Sanity points. If the roll fails, add no points. If the roll is fumbled, then the patient loses 1D6 Sanity points, and treatment by that analyst concludes: there<br />has been some sort of serious incident or dramatic setback in the therapy, and the relationship between patient and therapist has broken down beyond saving.</p>\n<p>In the game, psychoanalysis alone does not speed recovery from indefinite insanity, which requires 1D6 months of institutional (or similar) care, of which psychotherapy may form a part.</p>\n<p>Successful use of this skill can allow another person to cope with the subject of their phobia for a short time, or to see delusions for what they are. In play this would allow for an insane investigator to ignore the effects of a phobia or mania for a brief period, allowing a claustrophobe to hide in a broom cupboard for ten minutes, for example.

Allows simple electronic devices to be made. This is a skill for the present day&mdash;use Physics and Electrical Repair for electronic developments of the 1920s.</p>\n<p>Unlike the Electrical Repair skill, parts needed for electronics work often cannot be jury-rigged: they are designed for precise jobs. Often without the right microchip or circuit board, the skill-user is out of luck unless they can contrive some form of workaround. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Opposing skill/Difficulty level:</h2>\n<p>Time is a factor in fabrication or repair, and the difficulty level should be lowered if time is unlimited, especially if the character has access to manuals and parts.<br />If an investigator has the correct parts and instructions, putting together a standard computer should not even require a skill roll. &nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular difficulty: repairing minor damage to a computer or electronic device&mdash; the kind of service one might expect under warranty &nbsp;</li>\n<li>Hard difficulty: use scavenged parts to jury-rig a tracking device to plant in someone&rsquo;s car.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pushing examples:</h2>\n<p>Taking longer to construct or repair a device; researching new or other methodologies. &nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:</h2>\n<p>Fry circuitry or other delicate parts; take damage from electric shock; create a device that does something other than what was intended.</p>\n<p>If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she becomes paranoid, convinced that every item they come across contains electronic bugging devices: the telephone, the television, the refrigerator. <br style=\"font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px;\" /><br /></p>","opposingDifficulty":"","pushedFaillureConsequences":"","chat":""},"base":"1","value":-1,"attributes":{},"properties":{"push":true},"eras":{},"flags":{}},"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/electronics.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"BBn1pTFJyI127BNt","name":"Computer Use","permission":{"default":0,"6Y6opwuMdxc52cY3":3},"type":"skill","data":{"specialization":"","description":{"value":"<p>This skill allows the investigator to program in various computer languages; retrieve and analyze obscure data; break into a secured system; explore a complicated network; or detect or exploit intrusions, back doors and viruses.
