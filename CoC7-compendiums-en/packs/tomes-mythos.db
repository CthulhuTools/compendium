The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":1900001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"PhsrMYZlhHo96UTt","name":"Contact Deity: Cthulhu","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1D6+4 rounds","cost":{"mp":"","san":"1D6","pow":"5","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>May be performed anywhere.

The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"yYpln6H8tgAtBpDo","name":"Contact Deity: Dagon","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1D6+4 rounds","cost":{"mp":"","san":"1D6","pow":"5","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Should be cast at the edge of a saltwater ocean or sea.

One such cavern reputedly exists near Dunwich, Massachusetts.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">About Contact Spells</h2>\n<p>Contact spells are divided in to two separate groups: spells concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters and spells for contacting Mythos deities (see Contact Deity).</p>\n<p>Using Contact spells a cultist could get in touch with intelligent monsters and alien races, perhaps to learn more about history, magic, gods or alien species. The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":1900001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"cRWj57GwA9Q9Hk8s","name":"Create Gate","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1 hour (per POW)","cost":{"mp":"variable (to access)","san":"1 (to access)","pow":"variable","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>Gate allows the caster to create doorways between other lands or times, dimensions or worlds&mdash;allowing the user to travel great distances with a simple step.

A Gate may take many forms: common ones being indicated by a pattern of painted lines on a floor or wall, or a peculiar arrangement of stones in a field.

Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":1700001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]}],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"Zq7n8bLPRhWReEKz","sort":2400001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/spellbook.png","effects":[]}

Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":2000001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"FIWpJXNmwtUiz9WZ","name":"Contact Deity: Nyarlathotep","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1D6+4 rounds","cost":{"mp":"","san":"1D6","pow":"5","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>May be cast from anywhere, as befits this omnipresent entity.

The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":1900001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"PhsrMYZlhHo96UTt","name":"Contact Deity: Cthulhu","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1D6+4 rounds","cost":{"mp":"","san":"1D6","pow":"5","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>May be performed anywhere.

The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"glOUhTWYvNdEeW6w","name":"Resurrection","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1 or 2 rounds","cost":{"mp":"3","san":"1d10","pow":"","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>Reduces a corpse to its essential salts and compounds, a bluish-grey powder, or reverses the process to yield ultimately the form and soul of the deceased.

One such cavern reputedly exists near Dunwich, Massachusetts.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">About Contact Spells</h2>\n<p>Contact spells are divided in to two separate groups: spells concerned with contacting Mythos creatures and monsters and spells for contacting Mythos deities (see Contact Deity).</p>\n<p>Using Contact spells a cultist could get in touch with intelligent monsters and alien races, perhaps to learn more about history, magic, gods or alien species. The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":2000001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"glOUhTWYvNdEeW6w","name":"Resurrection","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1 or 2 rounds","cost":{"mp":"3","san":"1d10","pow":"","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>Reduces a corpse to its essential salts and compounds, a bluish-grey powder, or reverses the process to yield ultimately the form and soul of the deceased.

Sometimes they are learned as one spell, sometimes not. At the Keeper&rsquo;s discretion the effects may be combined or two separate rolls might be asked for, one to summon and a second to bind.</p>\n<p>If a monster arrives unbound or is come upon unexpectedly, it may be bound on the spot. The caster must know the Summon/Bind spell for that type of thing and must spend a round chanting before the thing can be bound. For the spell to take&nbsp;effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Each cast of the binding costs 1 Sanity point but no magic points. A binding works on only one creature at a time. One option open to the caster is to invest a number of magic points equal to one-fifth of the summoned creature&rsquo;s POW to gain a bonus die on the opposed POW roll to bind the monster.</p>\n<p>An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person it is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able to hold back from the fray. A creature presently bound cannot be re-bound until its present command is completed. A creature to be bound must be visible to the caster and within 100 yards. Binding requires an opposed roll and opposed rolls cannot be pushed; if the opposed roll is failed, the caster is in trouble!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be. The thing is bound to the caster until it fulfills a command (a bound thing without a command soon finds a way to leave). Orders might include carrying someone somewhere, presiding at some ceremony, being especially docile while being examined by a group of professors, appearing somewhere as a warning to those assembled&mdash;whatever can be imagined.</p>\n<p>Keep commands simple.

The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"yYpln6H8tgAtBpDo","name":"Contact Deity: Dagon","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1D6+4 rounds","cost":{"mp":"","san":"1D6","pow":"5","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Should be cast at the edge of a saltwater ocean or sea.

The general procedures for these spells are the same, but conditions may vary from spell to spell. Knowing one such spell is of no use whatsoever in attempting to cast another.

For example, 3 magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend five minutes chanting&mdash;the greater the chance for success, the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always a failure&mdash;a rolled result of 100 should always have bad consequences for the wizard concerned. The caster also loses 1D4 Sanity points per spell cast, whether the spell succeeds or not. If a success, one being appears per spell, [[/roll 2D10]] game minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing may also require a Sanity loss to see it. As the Keeper wishes, the thing arrives bound or the Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW roll versus the summoned being.

The caster must know the Summon/Bind spell for that type of thing and must spend a round chanting before the thing can be bound. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Each cast of the binding costs 1 Sanity point but no magic points. A binding works on only one creature at a time. One option open to the caster is to invest a number of magic points equal to one-fifth of the summoned creature&rsquo;s POW to gain a bonus die on the opposed POW roll to bind the monster.</p>\n<p>An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person it is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able to hold back from the fray. A creature presently bound cannot be re-bound until its present command is completed. A creature to be bound must be visible to the caster and within 100 yards. Binding requires an opposed roll and opposed rolls cannot be pushed; if the opposed roll is failed, the caster is in trouble!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be. The thing is bound to the caster until it fulfills a command (a bound thing without a command soon finds a way to leave). Orders might include carrying someone somewhere, presiding at some ceremony, being especially docile while being examined by a group of professors, appearing somewhere as a warning to those assembled&mdash;whatever can be imagined.</p>\n<p>Keep commands simple. The best rule of thumb is that a command has no more words than one-fifth of the thing&rsquo;s INT. Simple gestures such as pointing will be understood. Assume that the thing is always able to understand a straightforward command, whether spoken in English or Urdu.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":false,"summon":false,"bind":true,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"mxdLsskC4ALWyvwu","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/bind.png","effects":[]}],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"Zq7n8bLPRhWReEKz","sort":1300001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/spellbook.png","effects":[]}

If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group.

The general procedures for these spells are the same, but conditions may vary from spell to spell. Knowing one such spell is of no use whatsoever in attempting to cast another. Unless the Keeper wishes otherwise, the summon and the bind portions of each spell are learned together. Foolish is the impatient wizard who only learns to summon and not to bind&hellip; With the exception of Summon/Bind Servitor of the Outer Gods, these spells require the sacrifice of 1 magic point per 10 percentiles chance for success. For example, 3 magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend five minutes chanting&mdash;the greater the chance for success, the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always a failure&mdash;a rolled result of 100 should always have bad consequences for the wizard concerned. The caster also loses 1D4 Sanity points per spell cast, whether the spell succeeds or not. If a success, one being appears per spell, [[/roll 2D10]] game minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing may also require a Sanity loss to see it. As the Keeper wishes, the thing arrives bound or the Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW roll versus the summoned being. With a success, the thing is bound; with a failure, it attacks the caster and then returns from whence it came. Bound, the thing must obey one order by the caster, even to attacking its own kind, after which it is freed and returns from whence it came.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be. The thing is bound to the caster until it fulfills a command (a bound thing without a command soon finds a way to leave). Orders might include carrying someone somewhere, presiding at some ceremony, being especially docile while being examined by a group of professors, appearing somewhere as a warning to those assembled&mdash;whatever can be imagined.</p>\n<p>Keep commands simple. The best rule of thumb is that a command has no more words than one-fifth of the thing&rsquo;s INT. Simple gestures such as pointing will be understood.

Sometimes they are learned as one spell, sometimes not. At the Keeper&rsquo;s discretion the effects may be combined or two separate rolls might be asked for, one to summon and a second to bind.</p>\n<p>If a monster arrives unbound or is come upon unexpectedly, it may be bound on the spot. The caster must know the Summon/Bind spell for that type of thing and must spend a round chanting before the thing can be bound. For the spell to take&nbsp;effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Each cast of the binding costs 1 Sanity point but no magic points. A binding works on only one creature at a time. One option open to the caster is to invest a number of magic points equal to one-fifth of the summoned creature&rsquo;s POW to gain a bonus die on the opposed POW roll to bind the monster.</p>\n<p>An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person it is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able to hold back from the fray. A creature presently bound cannot be re-bound until its present command is completed. A creature to be bound must be visible to the caster and within 100 yards. Binding requires an opposed roll and opposed rolls cannot be pushed; if the opposed roll is failed, the caster is in trouble!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be.

The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll 1D100. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":200001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]},{"_id":"glOUhTWYvNdEeW6w","name":"Resurrection","permission":{"default":0,"UWCqrgKa2URGCPQQ":3,"rmGdDGeSETHxdMwa":3},"type":"spell","data":{"source":"Keeper Rulebook V7","castingTime":"1 or 2 rounds","cost":{"mp":"3","san":"1d10","pow":"","hp":null,"other":""},"description":{"value":"<p>Reduces a corpse to its essential salts and compounds, a bluish-grey powder, or reverses the process to yield ultimately the form and soul of the deceased.

The general procedures for these spells are the same, but conditions may vary from spell to spell. Knowing one such spell is of no use whatsoever in attempting to cast another. Unless the Keeper wishes otherwise, the summon and the bind portions of each spell are learned together. Foolish is the impatient wizard who only learns to summon and not to bind&hellip; With the exception of Summon/Bind Servitor of the Outer Gods, these spells require the sacrifice of 1 magic point per 10 percentiles chance for success. For example, 3 magic points gives a 30% chance for the spell to succeed. In general, for each magic point spent, the caster must spend five minutes chanting&mdash;the greater the chance for success, the longer the spell takes to cast. A result of 96-100 is always a failure&mdash;a rolled result of 100 should always have bad consequences for the wizard concerned. The caster also loses 1D4 Sanity points per spell cast, whether the spell succeeds or not. If a success, one being appears per spell, [[/roll 2D10]] game minutes after the chant concludes. The thing appearing may also require a Sanity loss to see it. As the Keeper wishes, the thing arrives bound or the Keeper may ask that the caster make an opposed POW roll versus the summoned being. With a success, the thing is bound; with a failure, it attacks the caster and then returns from whence it came. Bound, the thing must obey one order by the caster, even to attacking its own kind, after which it is freed and returns from whence it came.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be. The thing is bound to the caster until it fulfills a command (a bound thing without a command soon finds a way to leave). Orders might include carrying someone somewhere, presiding at some ceremony, being especially docile while being examined by a group of professors, appearing somewhere as a warning to those assembled&mdash;whatever can be imagined.</p>\n<p>Keep commands simple. The best rule of thumb is that a command has no more words than one-fifth of the thing&rsquo;s INT. Simple gestures such as pointing will be understood.

Sometimes they are learned as one spell, sometimes not. At the Keeper&rsquo;s discretion the effects may be combined or two separate rolls might be asked for, one to summon and a second to bind.</p>\n<p>If a monster arrives unbound or is come upon unexpectedly, it may be bound on the spot. The caster must know the Summon/Bind spell for that type of thing and must spend a round chanting before the thing can be bound. For the spell to take effect the caster must succeed in an opposed POW roll with the target. Each cast of the binding costs 1 Sanity point but no magic points. A binding works on only one creature at a time. One option open to the caster is to invest a number of magic points equal to one-fifth of the summoned creature&rsquo;s POW to gain a bonus die on the opposed POW roll to bind the monster.</p>\n<p>An attacking creature cannot be bound by the person it is fighting; however, it could be bound by a person able to hold back from the fray. A creature presently bound cannot be re-bound until its present command is completed. A creature to be bound must be visible to the caster and within 100 yards. Binding requires an opposed roll and opposed rolls cannot be pushed; if the opposed roll is failed, the caster is in trouble!</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Form of the Command</h2>\n<p>The caster&rsquo;s command to the thing must be specific and limited in duration: &ldquo;protect me from harm forever,&rdquo; would not be a valid command; however, &ldquo;slay that man in the corner,&rdquo; would be.
