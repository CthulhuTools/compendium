Ghosts generally possess only INT and POW, appearing as dim, misty forms. They haunt</span> certain locations or specific objects (such as a book, ship or automobile). Ghosts may or may not be vulnerable to magic or to exorcism. Ghosts especially seem to haunt locations in order to communicate the awfulness that prompted their formation. Sometimes a ghost gives clues or instructions, which, if carried out, let the anxious shade dissolve and find peace. Though all ghosts are terrifying, some are more loathsome than others; a <a class=\"inline-roll roll\" title=\"1D8\" data-mode=\"roll\" data-flavor=\"\" data-formula=\"1D8\"> 1D8</a> Sanity point loss should be the maximum loss for seeing a ghost.</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Special Powers</h2>\n<p>For a ghost&rsquo;s attack, use an opposed POW roll. As this happens, the ghost may be glimpsed as clawing at, enveloping or otherwise physically attacking the target. If the character fails the opposed POW roll, the character loses [[/roll 2D10]] POW.</p>\n<p>If the character can overcome the ghost, he or she causes the ghost to lose [[/roll 2D10]] POW. Any points of POW lost are forfeit. Ghosts of greater strength may drain [[/roll 3D10]] POW or more from a victim in a single combat round, but such potent entities still lose only [[/roll 2D10]] POW if overcome by the victim in a particular round.</p>\n<p>It is up to the Keeper to determine how a ghost can be laid to rest. Some possibilities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locating the source of attachment for the ghost and destroying it.</li>\n<li>Locating the physical remains of the ghost and salting and burning them.</li>\n<li>Exorcising the ghost (this might include opposed POW rolls).</li>\n<li>Enabling the ghost to fulfill its &lsquo;mission&rsquo; (preventing the death of a loved one, resolving unfinished business, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some ghosts can manipulate the environment around them, causing pots to fly off shelves, doors to open and telephones to ring&mdash;the infamous poltergeist. More powerful poltergeists may cause physical harm to the unwary by attacking with thrown items. In such instances, investigators should use the Dodge skill to avoid being hit and perhaps look for alternative means to calm or expel the angry spirit.</p>\n<p>Individually crafted ghosts are good sources of spooky scenarios. Entire campaigns can be devoted to the study of and exorcism of ghosts. Books to read as sources for ideas about ghosts include The Haunting of Hill House (both the novel and the 1963 film, The Haunting) by Shirley Jackson, the Shining by Stephen King, any of William Hope Hodgson&rsquo;s ghost stories (particularly the Carnacki the Ghost Finder tales), and the ghost stories of M. R. James. Henry James contributes a whole volume of ghost stories in his Collected Works and Rudyard Kipling set some excellent tales of ghosts in both England and India.</p>"}}},"sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/photos/traditional_horrors/Ghost.png","token":{"flags":{},"name":"Ghost","displayName":0,"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/photos/traditional_horrors/Ghost.png","tint":"","width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":360,"lightAngle":360,"lightColor":"","lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"type":"","speed":5,"intensity":5},"actorId":"GhostpGYQSSlMFju","actorLink":false,"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":""},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[]}
