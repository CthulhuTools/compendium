The caster should have a definite goal in mind; bargains might be struck, agreements made, plans negotiated.</p>\n<p>Contact spells do not give the caster the upper hand though; the spell is merely a method of establishing contact. Remember these are independent and intelligent beings with their own (usually antithetical to human) motivations&mdash;casters make contact at their peril! This is distinctly different to Summoning Spells that have the potential to allow casters to bind the summoned beings to their will.</p>\n<p>Procedures are much the same for each Contact spell, though particular conditions or requirements may be unique. Knowing one Contact spell is of no help in casting another. Many versions of Contact spells exist.</p>\n<p>Cast properly, this spell always works, unless there are no such things living within a convenient distance (flying polyps might journey from the City in the Sands to some part of Australia, but might ignore the chance to fly to North America).</p>\n<p>A Contact spell takes five to ten rounds to cast. The thing reached by the spell may appear in a game hour or take a game day or more to show up. For a random appearance in hours, roll [[/roll 1D100]]. Entities living nearby will walk, swim, dig or fly to the spell point. If the trip is too long, the thing called by the spell never shows up. Things from other dimensions can appear in any characteristic or evocative manner.</p>\n<p>The spell brings a random member of the species, presumably with its own motives. The caster should try to be alone or to be with no more than a small group, in order not to seem threatening. Once the contacted thing appears, it is free to depart, so if the caster has something to offer it, the chances for an extended meeting greatly improve. If a contacted species is large, such as a flying polyp, only one will likely appear. If it is human-sized or smaller, the Keeper may determine if several representatives arrive as a group. There is no guarantee that a contacted entity would rather bargain than devour the caster. If further contact seems of advantage to both sides, then some interesting results may emerge.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong> use words like&mdash;Union, Commune, Exchange, Commerce, Covenant, Pact, Concord, etc. For example: The Red Pact, Covenant of the Deep, and so forth.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":100001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]}

The infamous Ponape Figurine would be ideal but, where such an artifact is not available, the caster must create one. Once carved, the idol is enchanted with a sacrifice of 5 POW (once enchanted, the statuette will work indefinitely).</p>\n<p>The caster makes a blood sacrifice to the idol while performing the ritual. If successful, Zoth-Ommog&rsquo;s essence will inhabit the statue, animating it and telepathically communicating with the caster. Once this spell has been cast, the statuette exudes an air of menace and those who see it, or who spend significant amounts of time near it, must make a Sanity roll (0/1D3 loss).</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">About Contact Deity Spells</h2>\n<p>Contact Deity spells are unused except by the insane priests of these deities or by great independent sorcerers who hope to strike deals and win some small fraction of the deity&rsquo;s powers. The deities sought for contact are many and varied.</p>\n<p>The chance of successfully contacting the deity is equal to half the caster&rsquo;s POW (reduced after paying 5 POW cost). If the Hard POW roll succeeds, the deity (or some aspect of it) will contact the caster in a semi-friendly manner after a few hours or days. The deity is unlikely to give non-worshipers anything of value. If the deity is bored or offended, it will likely squash the caster or drive him or her insane.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatives names:</strong>&nbsp;each spell name usually reflects elements of the deity, its name, sphere of influence, powers, and so on. For example: Call Down the Opener of the Way, Entreat the Daemon Sultan, Give Praise to He who Slumbers beneath the Waters.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":"","notes":""},"type":{"call":false,"dismiss":false,"contact":true,"summon":false,"bind":false,"enchantment":false,"gate":false,"combat":false},"alternativeNames":[],"effects":[],"properties":{},"flags":{}},"folder":"hp7gyw1b7G8OkkAp","sort":1600001,"flags":{},"img":"modules/CoC7-compendiums-en/pictures/icons/contact.png","effects":[]}
