An investigator might have several versions of this skill in the spaces on the investigator sheet (such as Pilot Aircraft, Pilot Dirigible, etc.) Each starts at 01%.</p>\n<p>Anyone with modest skill can sail or fly on a calm day with good visibility, although skill rolls are required for storms, navigation by instrument, low visibility and other difficult situations. Bad weather, poor visibility and damage may raise the difficulty level of skill rolls to pilot air and water craft.</p>\n<h2>Opposing skill/Difficulty level:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular difficulty: make an emergency landing with a light aircraft in a farmer&rsquo;s field.</li>\n<li>Hard difficulty: pilot the craft in very poor conditions (e.g. extremely bad weather, faulty equipment).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Pushing examples:</h2>\n<p>Pulling the aircraft up and making a second and final attempt at landing; pushing the vehicle to its limit; making a risky maneuver to lose a pursuer.</p>\n<h2>Sample Consequences of failing a Pushed roll:&nbsp;</h2>\n<p>The results of a failed roll should fit the situation. It may be that the craft is somehow damaged, and repairs will have to be made before it can be used again (which may prove impossible in remote locations); passengers are injured during the maneuver or accident; you emergency-landed the plane in the jungle, and awake tied to large stones that circle a huge, bubbling cooking pot. Reserve burning wrecks for exceptional circumstances, such as when the pilot is insane, or when taking a crazy risk at high speed.</p>\n<p>If an insane investigator fails a pushed roll, he or she will believe that they are capable of death-defying stunts.
